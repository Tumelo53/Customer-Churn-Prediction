Feature Importance Analysis

📊 Model Performance

Random Forest Accuracy: 99.96%

ROC-AUC Score: ~1.00

The high performance indicates strong predictive relationships between engagement patterns and churn likelihood.
Key Insight

Feature importance analysis revealed that:

Support Calls was the strongest predictor of churn.

This suggests that high support interaction frequency may signal dissatisfaction or service issues leading to customer attrition.
